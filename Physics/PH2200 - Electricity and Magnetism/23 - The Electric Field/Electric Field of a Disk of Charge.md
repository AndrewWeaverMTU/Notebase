- Assume a uniform, infinitely thin disk of radius R that is charged with charge Q. 
- We can only really find it along the z axis (or central axis) without some heavy duty diff eq
- The equations are only valid for a positive z.
### Surface Charge Density
$$\eta = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{Q}{\pi\\R^2}$$
### On-Axis [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]]
$$E_{disk,z} = \frac{\eta}{2\epsilon_0}\left[1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}}\right]$$
