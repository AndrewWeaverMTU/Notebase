- We can imagine that the ring is a line of charge wrapped in a circle
### Linear Charge Density
$$\lambda = \frac{Q}{2\pi R}$$
### [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]] of a Ring
The equation for the electric field of a ring charge along its central axis (z in this case) can be derived as
$$ E_z= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{zQ}{(z^2 + R^2)^\frac{3}{2}}$$
