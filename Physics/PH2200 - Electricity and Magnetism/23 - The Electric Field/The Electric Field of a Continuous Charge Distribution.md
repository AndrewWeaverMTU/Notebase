- Link to [[Electric Fields]]
- For real objects, we can consider the charge to be continuous and talk about it as a whole charged object w/ a charge distribution (concentration).

### Linear Charge Density
- For an object of length $L$ with charge $Q$ spread uniformly along it, the linear charge density $\lambda$ is defined as:
$$\lambda = \frac{Q}{L}$$
### Surface Charge Density
- For an object of area $A$ with charge $Q$, the surface charge density $\eta$ is defined as:
$$\eta = \frac{Q}{A}$$
### Net Charge and Electrical Field of a Rod/Line
- We integrate the charge density along the length to get the net charge.
$$Q_\text{rod} = \lim_{\Delta Q \to 0}\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta Q_i=\int_\text{rod} dQ = \int_0^L \lambda dx$$

### Strategy for the Calculation of an Electrical Field
- There is a 3-step strategy to find the electric field of a continuous distribution
1. Divide the total charge $Q$ into many small point-like charges $\Delta Q$ 
2. Find the electric field of each point charge ($\Delta Q$)
3. Calculate the net field $\vec{E}_\text{net}$ by summing the fields of all the $\Delta Q$.
	- This sum becomes integration
