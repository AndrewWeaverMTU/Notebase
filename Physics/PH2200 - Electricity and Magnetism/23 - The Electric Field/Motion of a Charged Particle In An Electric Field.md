- When an [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]] acts on a charged particle, it exerts a force $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$ 
- Recalling that $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$, we can find that $$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m} = \frac{q}{m}\vec{E}$$
- Within a uniform field, the particle will move with a **constant acceleration**

### Example - Electron Deflection Beams
An electron gun creates a beam of electrons moving horizontally with a speed of $3.3*10^7$ m/s. The electrons enter a 2.0-cm-long gap between two parallel electrodes where the electric field is $\vec{E} = 5.0*10^4$ N/C, directed downward. In which direction and at what angle is the electron beam deflected by these electrodes?
