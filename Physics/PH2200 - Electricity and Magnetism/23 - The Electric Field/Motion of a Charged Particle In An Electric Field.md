- When an [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]] acts on a charged particle, it exerts a force $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$ 
- Recalling that $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$, we can find that $$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m} = \frac{q}{m}\vec{E}$$
- Within a uniform field, the particle will move with a **constant acceleration**

### Example - Electron Deflection Beams
An electron gun creates a beam of electrons moving horizontally with a speed of $3.3*10^7$ m/s. The electrons enter a 2.0-cm-long gap between two parallel electrodes where the electric field is $\vec{E} = 5.0*10^4$ N/C, directed downward. In which direction and at what angle is the electron beam deflected by these electrodes?


## Dipoles in a Uniform Field
- The net force on a dipole in a uniform electric field is ZERO
- If a dipole is not aligned with the field, the field applies [[Torque]] ($\tau$) causing it to align itself.
$$\tau = 2 \times dF = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}s \sin(\theta)\right)(qE) = pE \sin(\theta)$$
- $\theta$ - Angle from alignment with the electric field
## Dipoles in a Nonuniform Field
- For any nonuniform [[Electric Fields|Electric field]], the net force on a dipole is toward the direction of the strongest field.
- A dipole will experience a net force toward any charged object.
