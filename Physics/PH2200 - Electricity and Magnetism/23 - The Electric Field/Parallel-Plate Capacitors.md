- Composed of two metal plates (electrodes) with with charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign.

## [[Electric Fields|Electric Field]]
- Outside of a capacitor, the electric field is $\vec{0}$
- Inside, it is: $$\vec{E}_\text{capacitor} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}$$
- $A$ = the surface area of each electrode
- $\vec{E}_\text{capacitor}$ flows from the positive charge to the negative charge.
