- A charge's distribution is symmetric if there is a group of geometric transformations that don't cause any physical change

### Geometric Transformations
- Translate (displace) the charge parallel to an axis 
	- Move a charge ALONG one axis
- Rotate the charge about an axis
- Reflect the charge
	- can be parallel or perpendicular to the axis

## Types of Symmetry
- #### Planar Symmetry ####
	- $\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to the plane and is the same on both sides
	- Translate, Reflect
- #### Cylindrical Symmetry####
	- Can be translated, rotated, and reflected
	- **CANNOT** have a component parallel to the center axis
- #### Spherical Symmetry ####
	- $\vec{E}$ is the same in all direction
