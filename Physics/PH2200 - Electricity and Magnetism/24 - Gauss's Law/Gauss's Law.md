- The first of [[Maxwell's Equations]]
- **The [[Electric Flux]] through a closed surface is proportional to the amount of charge $Q_{in}$ within the surface**
- Useful for finding the electric fields of charge distributions that have a high degree of [[Symmetry]]
- Makes use of the [[Divergence Theorem]]
 $$\huge \Phi_E = \oint_{surface} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}$$
- $\Phi_E$ = Electric flux
- $\rho$ = 

### Open Vs Closed Surfaces
- **Open**
	- Doesn't fully enclose a volume
	- If the surface is flat, $d\vec{A}$ always points in the same direction
### Properties
- Gauss's can be used to establish three particular properties of conductors in equilibrium:
	1. Any excess charge is on the surface
	2. $\vec{E} = 0$ within the surface
	3. Externally, $\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to the surface
