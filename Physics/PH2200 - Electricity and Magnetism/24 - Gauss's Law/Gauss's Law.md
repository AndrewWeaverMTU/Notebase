- The first of [[Maxwell's Equations]]
- **The electric flux trhough a closed surface is proportional to the amount of charge $Q_{in}$ within the surface**
- Useful for finding the electric fields of charge distributions that have a high degree of [[Symmetry]]

### Properties
- Gauss's can be used to establish three particular properties of conductors in equilibrium:
	1. Any excess charge is on the surface
	2. $\vec{E} = 0$ within the surface
	3. Externally, $\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to the surface
