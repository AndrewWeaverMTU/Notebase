- The force between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges
- **Electric force between two objects decreases as distance increases**

## Definition
If two charged **particles** having charges q1 and q2 are a distance r apart, the particles exert forces on each other of magnitude:

#### Formula
$$
\vec{F}_{1 \space on \space 2} = \vec{F}_{2 \space on \space 1} = \frac{K \space |q_{1}| \space |q_{2}|}{r^2}
$$
$$
K = 8.99 * 10^9 \approx 9.0*10^9 \space \frac{N * m^2}{C^2}
$$

, Where K is called the electrostatic constant.
- These forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction

The forces are directed along the line joining the two particles. Like charges create a repulsive force, opposite charges create an attractive force.

## Permittivity Constant Version
- When looking at fields, we can rewrite the law using the permittivity constant (epsilon zero/naught), defined as:

#### Formula
$$
\epsilon_{0} = \frac{1}{4\pi K} = 8.85*10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N*m^2}
$$

```

We can use this to rewrite coulomb’s law as:

#### Formula
$$
F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{|q_{1}| \space |q_{2}|}{r^2}
$$

## Using Coulomb’s Law
2 Important things to remember:
1. Coulomb’s law applies only to POINT charges (has charge, has mass, has insignificant size or extension)
	1. Objects can be considered point charges if they are significantly smaller than the separation between them
2. Electric forces can be superimposed just like any other force
	1. There is a net force, same calculation ideas as mechanics.

## Example - Jumping Bead
A small plastic sphere charged to -10 nC is held 1.0cm above a small glass bead at rest on a table. The bead has a mass of 15mg and a charge of +10 nC. Will the glass bead “leap up” to the plastic sphere?

## Example - Point of Zero Force
Two positively charged particles q1 and q2 = 3q1 are 10.0cm apart on the x-axis. Where (other than at infinity) could a third charge q3 be placed so as to experience no net force?
