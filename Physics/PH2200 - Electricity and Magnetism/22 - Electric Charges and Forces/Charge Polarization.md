- [[Charge|Charged]] objects exert attractive forces on neutral objects by polarizing them.
- When you bring a charged object close to a neutral [[Conductors|conductive object]], it repels the like charges and attracts the opposite charges, thus creating a localized charge at one end of the object. This causes that end to be attracted to the charged object.

- [[Insulators]] can also be polarized, just on a smaller scale. This creates an **Electric Dipole**, where the negative charge is on one side of each atom and the positive charge is on the other. The charging object attracts one type of charge on each atom and repels the other, instead of separating the sea.
