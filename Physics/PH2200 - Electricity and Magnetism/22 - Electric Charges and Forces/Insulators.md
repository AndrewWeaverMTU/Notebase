- Valence electrons are tightly bound in an insulator, meaning that they do not flow from molecule to molecule easily. Little to no current can pass through an insulator
- Contrasted with [[Conductors]]

### Charging an Insulator
- Insulators can receive a surface charge through rubbing. If you rub a plastic rod with a piece of wool, the surface will gain a negative charge. However, these negative charges will NOT move throughout the rod; they will remain in place.
