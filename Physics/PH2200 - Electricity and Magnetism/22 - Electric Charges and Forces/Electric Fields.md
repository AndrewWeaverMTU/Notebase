- Electromagnetic forces are Long-range forces, like [[Gravity]]
- From a Newtonian perspective, the forces between two particles would have to respond to change instantaneously.
- [[Michael Faraday]] developed the idea of a magnetic field, where particle A creates a change in the space around it, then particle B interacts with that changed space.

### The Field Model
2 Postulates:
1. A set of source charges alter the space around them by creating an electric field **E** at ALL points in space
2. A separate charge *q* within the electric field experiences the force **F** = *q***E** exerted by the field. 
	- For a positive charge, the force is in the SAME direction as the field
	- For a negative charge, the force in the OPPOSITE direction of the field

- To find the source of an electric field, we can use a probe charge with a known location using the following Force:Charge ratio definition

#### Formula:
$$
\vec{E}(x,y,z) = \frac{\vec{F}_{\text{on q}} \text{ at point }(x,y,z)}{q}
$$

- | **E** | is called the electric field strength

## **The Electric Field of a Point [[Charge]]**
- Provided that the source charge is POSITIVE, we can use [[Coulomb’s Law]] and a probe charge to determine the electric field of a point charge by plugging the Coulomb’s law force in for **F**

#### Formula:
$$
\vec{E}_q = \frac{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{qq’}{r^2}}{q’} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|q|}{r^2}
$$
