- Generally metal
- Valence electrons within the material form a “sea of electrons”, allowing electrical current to flow through it easily.

### Nonmetal Conductors
- Ionic solutions like saltwater are good conductors. In these solutions, IONS are the charge carriers, not electrons.


## Charging Conductors
- Metallic conductors generally don’t receive charge through rubbing, but they can be charged by contact with another charged object. This is because electrons are free to move throughout a conductor.
- A conductor responds nearly instantaneously to the addition or removal of charge.

## Discharging Conductors
- Two conductors in contact share charges between them.
- When connected to the earth, a conductor is grounded and considered completely discharged.

## Isolated Conductors
- In steady state, the charges in a conductor are in electrostatic equilibrium
	- At rest (not moving around)
	- No net force on any charge 
- Due to this fact, excess charges are located on the surface of isolated conductors.
	- They bump each other around until they are on the surface and at rest.
