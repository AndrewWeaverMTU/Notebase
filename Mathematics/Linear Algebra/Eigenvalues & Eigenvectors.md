### Eigenvectors
- A vector that can be multiplied to a specific matrix and return a scalar multiple of that vector. 
- All scalar multiples of eigenvectors are also eigenvectors

### Eigenvalues
- The scalar multiple corresponding to the multiplication of eigenvectors

### Determining Eigenvalues of a Matrix
For an n-dimensional matrix A,
[[Determinants|det]](A - (lambda) I)

}
```

### Determining Eigenvectors
- Take the eigenvalues of the matrix, plug them into A-(lambda)I, get the solution in parametric vector form. The vectors in parametric vector form are your eigenvectors.

	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.10.31 - 14.10pm.writing"
