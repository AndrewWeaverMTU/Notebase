- A linear system of ODEs can be written in the form x’ = Ax + f(t)
- A linear homogenous system of ODEs is one that can be written in the form X’ = AX

- x and x’ are vectors of functions, generally the different orders of derivatives in the system of equations.

### Example: Converting a (nonhomogenous) system of ODEs into matrix form

```

### Solving Homogenous Linear Systems of ODEs
- To find the solution of a linear homogenous solution, find the [[Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors|Eigenvalues]] the matrix A. 
	- If it has all distinct real eigenvalues:
