- A method of solving first-order [[Linear Differential Equations]]
- To use this method, we must first have the equation in standard form:
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.10 - 13.21pm.writing"
}
```
- Basically, we need  (dy/dx + (something x) * y = (something x))
- there are a few ways to perform this method. I’ll take notes on two of them, which I will call the “icky” method and the “McCoy” method
- operates by multiplying a function mu(x) to the entire equation, allowing us to more easily integrate it.
### McCoy Method
- Treats it more like what it is, which is a weird form of u-sub
- Makes use of the [[Differential Operator]]

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.10 - 13.29pm.writing"
}
```

#### Example

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.10 - 13.55pm.writing"
}
```

### Icky Method
- We know the general form of the solution, just plug it in.

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.10 - 13.25pm.writing"
}
```
