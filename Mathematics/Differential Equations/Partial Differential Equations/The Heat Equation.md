## Prerequisite Information
Before discussing the actual heat equation, there are a few important definitions to get down:

```handwritten-ink

}
```
- Specific heat: amount of heat energy that it takes to raise a unit of mass by one unit of temperature (the calorie for water)
- heat flux: amount of thermal energy that flows to the right (in the positive direction) per unit surface area per unit time.
- Q(t) just represents any external sources or sinks.

## The Heat Equation
Using the quantities defined above, we can define the heat equation as:

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.14 - 12.41pm.writing"
}
```

In this form, we don’t usually know what C and (rho) are, so we usually can’t solve it. HOWEVER, fourier is here to help!

### Fourier’s Law

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.14 - 12.44pm.writing"
}
```
- Thermal Conductivity: ability of a material to conduct heat

Plugging fourier’s law into the heat equation gives us:

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.14 - 12.48pm.writing"
}
```
