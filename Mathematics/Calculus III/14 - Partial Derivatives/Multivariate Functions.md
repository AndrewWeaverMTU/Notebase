## Level Curves
- A method to create a 2d graph of a 3d function, generally viewed from above
- A set of curves $\huge f(x,y) = k$, where $k$ is a constant value for each individual curve. 
- Creates a set of layers called *traces*, like a map of a mountain.

## Functions of 3+ Variables
- Hard to graph normally (4+ space hard D:), but we can use the same principle as level curves to get a graphical idea of the function.

### Level Surfaces
- A set of surfaces $\huge f(x,y,z) = k$, where k is a constant value for each individual surface
