 ### Line Integrals of Vector Functions over a parameterized path C.
- We need to find the parameterized path C where **r**(t) : C
- We integrate **F** (a vector field) over a directed path element.
- Tangent vector (& unit tangent in the derivation shown below) are used to orient the direction of the path.

### Line Integrals Over a Scalar Field
- You can calculate a line integral over a scalar field as well. This is given by:
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.3 - 8.08am.writing"
}
```
- This gives us the area between the curve c and the function f.
- Not hard to solve. It’s an integral. Use your brain.

#### Example

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",

}
```


### Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

^8ceec3

- Given the gradient vector and a function of two or three variables, the following can be considered the FTCII for line integrals
- To use the fundamental theorem, it is **NOT NECESSARY TO PARAMETERIZE THE PATH**
- C must be a smooth curve (differentiable at all points along its path)

### Conservative Vector Fields and Potential Functions
- In a [[Gradient Vector Fields|Conservative Vector Field]], the line integral is path independent. Only the endpoints matter. 
- To use the [[#^8ceec3|Fundamental Theorem]], we need to be able to tell if **F** is a gradient (conservative) vector field and, if it is, we need to be able to find f(~), the potential function.
- Since the [[Curl]] of a gradient vector field is zero, we can use it to test to see if we can use the Fund. Theorem.
