$$\huge W = F \cdot D$$
### Variable Force
$$\huge W = \int_a^bF(x)dx$$
#### Example
Suppose that 2J of work is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 30cm to 42cm.

How much work is needed to stretch the spring form 35cm to 40cm? If the spring is stretched from its natural length with 3J of work, how far was it stretched?

#### Example 2
- A pickup truck is towing a 500lb trailer through Wisconsin with a load of 1000lbs of shredded hceese. Suddenly, a leak opens up in the bottom of the trailer, causing it to lose 1lb of cheese for every foot it travels. The nearest place to pull over is 500ft ahead. How muhc work will the truck do pulling the trailer over that distance?
