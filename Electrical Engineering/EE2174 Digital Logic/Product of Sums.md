- Like [[Sum of Products]], but focusing on [[NOT Gate|NOTs]] and zeroes.
- “if the zero conditions are NOT met, output 1”

## Procedure
- [[OR Gate]] the variables of a 0-row (max term)
- NOT the literals that are 1
- AND the max terms together

Shorthand:$$
F = \Pi_{Variables}\text{(Zero Rows)}$$
