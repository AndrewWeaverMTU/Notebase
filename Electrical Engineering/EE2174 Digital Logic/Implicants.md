- in k-maps, groups of ones which obey the following set of rules:
	1) Must contain a number of 1s equal to a power of 2s (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
	2) Must be a standard RECTANGULAR shape
	3) cannot be diagonal
- The bigger the implicant, the better!
- 3-variable k-maps get a little more complicated

## Prime Implicant
- The biggest possible implicant that can be made around a group of 1s
- **Always** go towards prime implicants **EVEN IF IT CAUSES OVERLAP**

## Distinguished-1 Cell 
- A a cell only circled by 1 implicant

## Essential Prime Implicant (EPI)
