- Every steady-state voltage and current in the network should have the same form and frequency
- This being the case, everything will have the same complex component, so it can be divided out and dropped, leaving us with just the polar component, called a **phasor**
- A vectorization of AC values to make them easily graphable in cartesian coordinates
- Phasors are notated with capital letters

- Eliminating the cartesian complex term allows us to analyze functions in the frequency domain without worrying about the time domain. 
- Since we lose the time domain, we CANNOT find the transient response using phasors.
