- Defined by a second-order DE
- Resistors & two storage elements (Inductors, Capacitors, etc)
- More complicated than [[First-Order Transient Circuits]], Here’s The basic procedure to solve them:
	1. Find initial values of the steadier variables (capacitor voltage, inductor current)
	2. Create an equation for the circuit using KCL (parallel) or KVL (series)
	3. Differentiate all with respect to t.
	4. Use the [[Characteristic Equation]] method to solve.
