- A first-order circuit will require us to solve a first-order DE of the form

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.2 - 1.32am.writing"
}
```
- if we only consider the cases where f(t) = some constant A, then the general solution is derived as follows:

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.2 - 1.35am.writing"
}
```
- τ (tau) is referred to as the **time constant**
	- The circuit is generally considered to be in steady state once five time constants have passed (5τ)
- K1, the particular solution, is called the “**steady state solution**”

### Time Constant in an RC Circuit
- in an RC circuit, the Time Constant = R(eq) x C

}
```
### Time Constant in an RL circuit
- In an RL circuit, the Time Constant = L / R(eq)
