We usually consider sinusoids of the form:

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.17 - 10.00am.writing"
}
```
## Comparing Waveforms
- If one waveform occurs before another, we say it “leads” that waveform by some value in radians. 
- If one waveform occurs afterward, we say it “lags” that waveform by some value in radians.
- Theta and phi in these waveforms are called the **phase angles**
- If the phase angles are equal, they are “in phase”. If not, they are “out of phase”
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.17 - 10.04am.writing"
}
```

## Converting Between Sine and Cosine
- 90º (π/2) difference between sine and cosine
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.17 - 10.10am.writing"
}
```
#### Negative Identities

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.17 - 10.15am.writing"
}
```

#### Angle-Sum / Angle-Difference Relationships

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Writing/2025.11.17 - 10.16am.writing"
}
```
