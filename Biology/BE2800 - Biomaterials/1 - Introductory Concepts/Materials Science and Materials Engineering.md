## **Materials Science**
- Investigating relationships between structures and properties
- Creating new materials

## **Materials Engineering**
- Create products from existing materials
- Develop materials processing techniques
	- raw materials -> final form
	- changing properties & micro/nanostructure
	- iron + carbon -> steel

### **Why are materials important?**
- They drive advances in society
	- Stone age -> bronze age -> iron age -> current age (silicon? Nanomaterials? Polymer?)
	- Ages are defined by the materials used
