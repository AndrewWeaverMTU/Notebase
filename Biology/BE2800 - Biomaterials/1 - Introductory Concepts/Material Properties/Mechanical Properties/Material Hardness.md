- Defined as a material’s resistance to local, permanent deformation
	- Like indentation, scratching, and wear
- Important because many devices fail at interfaces & local surface damage often precedes global failure

- Surface Property 
- Finer features result in increased hardness. 

### Testing Hardness
- Generally measured through surface indentation.
- How well a material resists surface deformation is related to its hardness.
