- There have been a series of shifts in thinking about biomaterials

## **1st Gen - Inert (Pre 1970s)**
- “Do no harm”
- Materials should enter the body and remain unchanged
- Examples - titanium, Teflon, PMMA

## **2nd Gen - Bioactive (1970s)**
- Active materials that interact with the body to produce a desired effect
- Specifically designed to integrate with bodily structures and functions
- Examples - PLA, PGA, PLGA

## **3rd Gen - Targeted/Regenerative (1990s)**
- Precise integrations with cells and proteins 
- Materials are tailored and specifically bioactive to their application
