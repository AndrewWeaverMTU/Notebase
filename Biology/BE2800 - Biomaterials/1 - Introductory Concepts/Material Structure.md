Material structure is made up of a couple qualities
1. Atomic/Molecular Structure
	- Chemical Composition
	- Type of bonding
	- Molecular Weight ([[Polymers]])
	- Crosslinking ([[Polymers]])
2. Microstructure
	- Crystallinity vs amorphous regions ([[Polymers]])
	- Grain Size (metals, ceramics)
	- Phase distribution
	- Porosity
3. Surface Structure
	- Surface Chemistry
	- Surface roughness/topography


$$
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F_{on \space q}}}{q}
