- Location of implant matters
- Type of material matters (metal, polymer, ceramic, composite)
- Shape of implant & complexity matters
- Material degradation characteristics (permanent vs resorbable, how it wears and weathers)
- surface properties (chemical and physical properties)
	- functional groups, roughness
- bulk properties (chemical, physical, and mechanical properties)
	- composition, thermal expansion, strength
