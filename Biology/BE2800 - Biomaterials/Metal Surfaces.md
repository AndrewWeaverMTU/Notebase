- More than just an oxide film
- Have several layers arranged in a gradient

### Chemical Surface Layer
- 1-10nm
- Oxide layer and adsorbed molecules
- Directly contacts proteins, cells, and coatings
- Controls corrosion and initial [[Biocompatability]]
- Modulates friction and chemical/adhesive wear at the outermost surface

### Near-Surface / Subsurface Layer
- 1-100$\mu$m
- Properties gradually change from the bulk due to mechanical, thermal, and chemical effects at the surface
- Influences hardness, stress, and microstructure
- Enhances coating adheasion and mech wear resistance

### Bulk Metal
- Determines structural properties like load-bearing, [[Fatigue Resistance]], [[Material Plasticity|resistance to plastic deformation]], and [[Thermal Conductivity]].
- Provides support for wear by preventing subsurface deformation or failure under load.
