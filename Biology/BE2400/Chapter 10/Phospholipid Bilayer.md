- Lipids cause water to arrange in an odered, unfavorable cage-like structure. Forcing lipids into a bilayer reduces this effect.
- Protein-free lipid bilayers are impermeable to ions

### Membrane Solubility
- Small, nonpolar molecules dissolve the best
- the more hydrophobic something is (nonpolar), the better it is at dissolving
- Ions don’t dissolve, large polar molecules don’t dissolve.
