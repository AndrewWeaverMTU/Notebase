- Amphiphilic and cone-shaped molecules that can disrupt hydrophobic association
- "Solubilizing"
- Disrupts lipid bilayer and brings the protein into sol'n as a protein-lipid-detergent complex.
- Phospholipids in membranes are also solubilized by the detergent as lipid-detergent micelles. 
- *** They become water soluble
- Used in the Na-K pump

- In research & applications:
	- Molecules are purified and incorporated into phospholipid vesicles
	- Allows us to analyze the activities of membrane transporters, ion channels, & signaling receptors.
	- Can help us determine which proteins work for particular cell functions.
	- Can be use in immunochemistry staining
