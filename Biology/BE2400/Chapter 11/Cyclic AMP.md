- Cyclic Adenosine monophosphate
- Unstable, short-lived in the cell
	- rapidly degraded by cAMP phosphodiesterase
- Concentration in the cell is regulated by controlling adenylyl cyclase activity with Gs(stimulators/excitatory) or Gi (Inhibitory) [[G Proteins]]

- PKA (Protein Kinase A) mediates most of cAMP’s interactions.
