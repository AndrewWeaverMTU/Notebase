- alpha and gamma subunits are covalently attached lipid molecules
- beta and gamma subunits form a single functional unit
- Alpha subunit contains:
	- Ras domains (GTPase domain), which provides one of the faces of the GTP-binding pocket

### Activation of a G protein
- Signal molecule changes the conformation of the GPCR
- Receptor binds to and alters the conformation of a G protein
- Receptor stays active while the [[Extracellular Signal Molecules|Extracellular Signal Molecule]] is bound to it.
	- Receptor can catalyze activation of MULTIPLE g-proteins.

### Functions of G Proteins
- Some regulate production of [[Cyclic AMP]]
	- An extracellular signal can trigger an increase in cAMP concentration by more than 20 folds in a few seconds.
- Some signal via phospholipids
