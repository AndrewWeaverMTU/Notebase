- Most skeletal muscles are arranged in **antagonistic pairs** 
	- Agonist contracts, antagonist stretches.
	- Can change for different movements
- Some agonists cross other joints before it reaches the joint that it moves.
	- **Synergists** are muscles that help the agonist by stabilizing joints. 
- **Fixators** - stabilize the origin of the agonist.
