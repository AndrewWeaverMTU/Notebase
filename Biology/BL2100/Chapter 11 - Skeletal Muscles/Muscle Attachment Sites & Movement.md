- The longer the fibers in a muscle, the more range it has
- The greater the cross-sectional area of a muscle, the greater the strength. 
### Origin
- The attachment of the muscle to the stationary bone, the part that (usually) doesn’t move

### Insertion
- Attachment of the muscle to the movable bone, which is USUALLY the one that moves. 

### Reverse Muscle Action
- A weird form of muscle action that flips the function of the origin and the insertion
	- Origin moves, insertion is stationary.
