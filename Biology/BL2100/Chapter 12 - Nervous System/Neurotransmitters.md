### Inhibitory Neurotransmitters

^017a8d

- Hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane to decrease the likelihood of an [[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^9e0a6b|Action Potential]]. (More negative = further from threshold) 

### Excitatory Neurotransmitters
- Depolarize the postsynaptic membrane to INCREASE the likelihood of an [[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^9e0a6b|Action Potential]]
- (Less Negative = Closer to threshold)

### Removal of Neurotransmitters
- 3 Ways to remove a Neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft:
	1. Diffusion
		- Once out of reach of its receptors, it can’t cause an effect
	2. Enzymes Degradation
		- Acetylcholineasterase breaks down Acetylcholine, making it unable to cause it effect
	3. Uptake into cells
		- Actively transported back into the neuron (reuptake) or into a neighboring neuron (uptake) by neurotransmitter transporters

### Common Neurotransmitters
- Acetylcholine
	- Best studied, both excitatory and inhibitory
- Amino Acids
	- Glutamate + aspartame = excitatory; GABA = inhibitory
- Biogenic amines
	- norepinephrine (awakening), dopamine (pleasure), serotonin (induction of sleep)
- ATP and other purines
- Nitric oxide
- Carbon monoxide
