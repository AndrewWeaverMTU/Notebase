- Excitable cells communicate with each other via action potentials or graded potentials
### Action Potentials ###

^9e0a6b

- Good for short or long distances
- Sequence of rapidly occurring events that decrease & eventually reverse membrane potential (depolarize) and eventually restore it to the resting state (repolarize)
- Only occur if the membrane potential reaches threshold (-55mV).
- CONSISTENT DEPOLARIZATION (Amplitude)
- Frequency can change
- **Resting State**
	- All voltage-gated channels are closed.
	- At resting membrane potential.
	- Buildup of negative on inside and positive charges along outside of membrane
- **Depolarizing Phase**
	- Membrane potential reaches threshold
	- Na+ channels open, Na+ moves into neuron
	- Positive charges build up within, membrane depolarizes.
- **Repolarizing Phase Begins**
	- Na+ channel inactivation gates close, K+ channels open. Membrane starts to repolarize as K+ begins to leave and e- starts to build up on the inside surface.
- **Repolarization Continues -> Ends**
	- K+ outflow continues.
	- More negative charges build up.
	- Once we hit/pass resting potential, K+ gates close.
### Graded Potentials ###

^121b82

- Good for only short distances 
- Small deviations in resting [[Membrane Potential]]
- Hyperpolarizing - more negative
- Depolarizing - More positive
- Occurs in response to the opening of [[Membrane Channels#^50a7dc | Mechanically Gated Channels]] or [[Membrane Channels#^b98729 | Ligand-Gated Channels]]
- Amplitude depends on the stimulus strength (directly proportional)

# Conduction of Signals
### Continuous Conduction
- Step-by-step depolarization/repolarization across entire axon
- Unmyelinated Axons

### Saltatory Conduction
- Depolarization only at [[Neuroglia#^fab46b | Nodes of Ranvier]] and "leaping" from node-to-node.
- Myelinated axons
- Much quicker and more efficient
