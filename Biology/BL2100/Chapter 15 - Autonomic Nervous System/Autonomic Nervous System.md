- Part of the [[Peripheral Nervous System]]
- Sympathetic
	- smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands
- Enteric
	- Smooth muscle & glands SPECIFICALLY in the gi tract
- Tissues it engages with are called **Visceral Effectors** because they’re generally located within the viscera.
- Generally operates without conscious control.

- Contains two main branches
	- Most organs are innervated by **both** branches. One is usually excitatory while the other is inhibitory.

## Autonomic Nerve Pathways

^93d903

- Unlike with somatic motor neurons that use a single axon extending to the effector, autonomic motor neurons usually are made up of **two motor neurons in series**. 
	- The first [[Myelination of Neurons|Myelinated]] [[Preganglionic Neurons]] extends from the [[Central Nervous System]] to the Autonomic Ganglion (a collection of neuronal cells). The second **unmyelinated** neuron extends from the ganglion to the effector.
	- Alternatively, some of the first neurons interact with Chromaffin cells in the adrenal medullae (inside adrenal glands), which produce **epinephrine and norepinephrine**
		- Autonomic Motor Neurons can release ACH or Norepinephrine
