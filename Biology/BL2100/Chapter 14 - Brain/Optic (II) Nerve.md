- Technically not actually a nerve! It’s a tract of the [[Brain]]
- Entirely sensory

### Path to the Brain
- Rods and cones -> bipolar cells -> ganglion cells (order of signal transmission)
- [[Axons]] of ganglion cells combine to form the optic nerves. 
- ~10mm posterior to the eyeball, the optic nerves join and form the Optic Chiasm.
	- Medial halves of the axons cross to the other side, lateral halves stay on their sides. (respective to the eyes)
- After (posterior to) the optic chiasm, the axons form optic tracts, which generally end in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the [[Thalamus]], where they [[Synapse]] with motor neurons that control the extraocular and intrinsic eye muscles.
