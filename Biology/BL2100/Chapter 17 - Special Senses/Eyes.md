### **Eyelids**

^9187f9

- Eyelids are also called palpebrae
- Upper eyelid is more movable
	- controlled by the [[Levator Papelbrae Superioris]]
- Space between eyelids is called the palpebral fissure
- Inner corner is the medial commissure, outer is the lateral commissure
- [[Lacrimal Apparatus|Lacrimal Caruncle]] - In medial commissure, does the tears and the eye boogers.
- #### **Layers of the Eyelids**
	- (Superficial -> Deep)
	1. Tarsal Plate
	2. Tarsal Glands
	3. Conjunctiva
		1. Palpebral Conjunctiva
		2. Bulbar Conjunctiva

## **Anatomy of the Eye - Layers (Superficial->Deep)**
### **Fibrous Layer**
- Anterior [[Cornea]]
- Posterior [[Sclera]]

### **Vascular Layer**
- Middle Layer of the eye
- Choroid of the Eye
	- Like the [[Choroid Plexus]] of the brain, a capillary network that provides nutrients to the [[Retina]]
	- Contains melanocytes
	- Absorbs stray light rays
- Ciliary Body
	- Extends from the ora serrata - jagged anterior part of the [[Retina]]
	- Ciliary processes protrude form the ciliary body
		- Zonular fibers (suspension ligaments) extend and attach to the [[Lens]] ^2beb6d
	- [[Ciliary Muscle]] is a circular band of smooth muscle that controls tension of Zonular fibers
- Contains the [[Iris]]

### **Retina**
![[Retina]]

## **Interior Anatomy of the Eyeball**
divided into two chambers
### **Anterior Cavity**
- 2 Main Chambers
- Anterior chamber - Between [[Cornea]] and [[Iris]]
- Posterior chamber - Between [[Iris]] and [[#^2beb6d|Zonular Fibers]]
