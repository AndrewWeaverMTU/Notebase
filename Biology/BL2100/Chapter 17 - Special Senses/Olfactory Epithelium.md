- Receptor surface for [[Olfaction]] in the nose.
- Occupies the superior part of the nasal cavity

Consists of 3 kinds of cells
### **Olfactory Sensory Neurons**
- First-order [[Neurons]]
- Olfactory Cilia extend from the [[Dendrites]], engaging in olfactory transduction (conversion of a stimulus into a [[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^121b82|Graded Potential]])
- Olfactory receptors, proteins within the olfactory cilia, detect inhaled chemicals (odorants)
 - Only live for ~2months before they are replaced with new cells.
	 - This is noteworthy & abnormal. Mature neurons usually aren’t replaced

### **Supporting Epithelial Cells**
- Columnar Epithelial Cells that make up the mucous membrane of the nose
- Provide support, nourishment, and electrical insulation for the neurons
- Help detoxify chemicals

### **Basal Epithelial Cells**
 - Stem cells, located in the bases of the supporting cells
 - Differentiate into new Olfactory Sensory Neurons

### Olfactory Glands
- In addition to the above types of cells, create the mucus that
