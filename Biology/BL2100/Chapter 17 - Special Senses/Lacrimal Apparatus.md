- Produces and drains lacrimal fluid (tears)
- Tear production is initiated by the  [[Facial (VII) Nerve]]

## **Parts of the Lacrimal Apparatus**
### **Lacrimal Glands**
- amygdaloid gland
- secrete tears
	- Composed of water, salts, mucus, and lysozyme (bactericidal enzyme)
- drain into 6-12 excretory lacrimal ducts that empty tears onto the [[Eyes#^9187f9|Upper Eyelid]] 

### **Lacrimal Canaliculi**
- 2 ducts, the transporter for tears
- “canaculi” - like an italian taxi driver in NY, does the transport
- Leads into the lacrimal sac

### **Lacrimal Sac**
- Receives from canaliculi
- Infection of lacrimal sacs is called dacryocystis 
	- Dacryo- -> lacrimal sac
	- - itis-> inflammation of
- Empties into the nasolacrimal duct

### **Nasolacrimal Duct**
- Carries the lacrimal fluid into the nasal cavity, where it mixes with mucus.
