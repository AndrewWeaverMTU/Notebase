- [[Organs]] made up of several different tissues working together
	- Issues tissue, cartilage, dense connective tissue, epithelium, adipose tissue, and nervous tissue

## Bone Structure
### Along the Length
- Diaphysis ^ef8816
	- Shaft of the bone
- Epiphyses
	- Proximal and distal **ends of the bone**
- Metaphyses ^43440b
	- Spot between the diaphysis and epiphyses
	- Contains the growth plates ([[Epiphyseal Plate]])
### Depth
- Articular Cartilage
	- Thin layer of Hyaline [[Cartilage]] that covers the part of the epiphyses where the bone forms a joint. 
	- Reduces friction, absorbs shock
- Periosteum
	- Connective tissue sheath & blood supply that covers all parts of the bone not covered by articular cartilage
	- Composed of outer fibrous layer (dense irregular connective tissue) and inner osteogenic layer (cells)
	- Enables bone to grow in thickness, protects bone, aids in bone repair.
	- Attached to the underlying bone by perforating fibers (collagen bundles)
- Medullary Cavity
	- Marrow Cavity - hollow space in the diaphysis that contains the bone marrow.
