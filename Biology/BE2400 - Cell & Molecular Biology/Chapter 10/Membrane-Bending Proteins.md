- Shape membranes
- Lipids would just form a straight line.
- With proteins, they can bend and curve and form a cell & layers.
- Hydrophobic region can insert into layer to pry lipid head groups apart
- Proteins can form rigid scaffolds (like [[Cytoskeleton]]s) that bind to lipid head groups to mold and stabilize
- Proteins can bind and cluster lipids with large head groups, bending the membrane.
