- Protein free [[Phospholipid Bilayer|lipid bilayers]] are impermeable to ions
- diffusion is inversely proportional to hydrophilia
- Integral [[Transmembrane Proteins]]
- Passive transport down electrochemical gradient, active transport against electrochemical gradient`
### Transporters

^03b4c5

- alternates between two conformations (flip-flop). 
- can be active or passive
- pumps
### Channels
- Form a pore across a membrane
- Faster than Transporters
- passive
- Switch between open and closed states using a gate.
	- Gates can be voltage gated, ligand-gated, or mechanically gated
	- [[Membrane Channels]] - Notes from A&P
- Ion channels exhibit selectivity, only allowing certain ions through

### Uniporters, Symporters, Antiporters
- #### Uniporters
	- Facilitate the passive movement of a single solute
- #### Coupled transporter ^6d26a5
	- #### Symporters
		- same direction of transport
	- #### Antiporters
		- Opposite direction of transport

### Communication
- [[Neurons]] use Transport Proteins to generate [[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^9e0a6b|Action Potentials]] - A&P Notes
- change membrane voltage to until it drops below threshold potential
- *** All or none
