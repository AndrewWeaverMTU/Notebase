- Amphiphilic
- 3 Main Types
	- Integral Membrane Proteins
	- Lipid-Anchored Proteins
	- Peripheral Proteins
- Many are glycosylated
	- Oligosaccharide chains and disulfide bonds are on the OUTER layer of the membrane
	- Fatty acids are all on the inside of the [[Plasma Membrane]]
- Can be solubized and purified in [[Detergents]]
- Many diffuse in the plane of the membrane (across/around the same layer)
	- Proteins aren't fixed, they're usually changing locations
	- Membrane proteins do not flip-flop across the lipid bilayer
		- Protein heads are polar. They can't flip, the hydrophilic head can't pass through they hydrophobic environment. 
	- [[Restricting the Lateral Mobility of Proteins]]]- Membrane recovery is often measured by Flourescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
	- Shoot it with laser, wait until the color is normal again,.
	- This allows us to find the diffusion constant of the membrane.
- The membrane is shaped by [[Membrane-Bending Proteins]]
