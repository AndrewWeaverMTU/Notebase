- Carry specific signals and bind to specific receptors with very high affinity
- Receptors are usually [[Transmembrane Proteins]] on the surface of the target cell
- Sometimes, the signal molecule will instead diffuse across the [[Plasma Membrane|Cell Membrane]] to bind to a receptor inside the cell. 
	- Nuclei have receptors that regulate gene expression

- Each cell is programmed to respond in a specific way to the [[Extracellular Signals]] carried by the specific molecules
- If deprived of survival-necessary signals, the cells will die.

- Signals can command the cell to differentiate into a specific specialized cell.
	- Changes in gene expression by switching on or off different genes.
