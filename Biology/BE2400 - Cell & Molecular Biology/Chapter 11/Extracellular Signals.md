### Contact-Dependent Signaling
- Requires cells to be in direct [[Plasma Membrane|Membrane]]-membrane contact
- Example: [[Gap Junctions]] in cardiac muscle, which allow direct communication through the cells where gap junction channels form.

- Other signals can go over distances without contact
### Paracrine Signaling
- A **deditcated signaling cell** Releases local mediators into the extracellular space, which act on local neighboring cells. 
	- A group of cells being 
### Autocrine Signaling
- Cells release and respond their own signal molecules
	- A group of cells mingling and talking amongst themselves
- cancer cells do a LOT of autocrine signaling
- used in immune response with T-lymphocytes causing themselves to release more T cells
### Synaptic Signaling
- Performed by [[Neurons]]
- Transmission of electrical signals along the [[Axons]], release of [[Neurotransmitters]] at chemical [[Synapse|Synapses]]
- Rapid local transmission, very precise
- Acts at high local concentrations
- Signals can be rapidly terminated

### Endocrine Signaling
- Secretion of hormones into the bloodstream for distribution throughout the body.
- Longest distance signaling method.
- Slower long distance, acts over the entire organism. Not a precise method. 
- Acts at low concentrations. 
- Cannot be rapidly terminated. Once it’s started, the gook is in the bloodstream and it takes a while to leave.
