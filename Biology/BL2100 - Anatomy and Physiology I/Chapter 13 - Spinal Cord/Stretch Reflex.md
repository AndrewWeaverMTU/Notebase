- cause contraction of a [[Skeletal Muscle]] in response to stretching of the muscle
- [[Reflexes#^76e0d5|monosynaptic]]

### Steps of a Stretch Reflex
1. Stretching stimulates sensory receptor (muscle spindle)
2.  Sensory neuron becomes excited
3. Within integrating center ([[Spinal Cord]]), sensory neuron activates motor neuron
4. Motor neuron is excited
5. Effector (same muscle as the one that sent the sensory signal) contracts and relieves the stretching.
