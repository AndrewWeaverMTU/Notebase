- Good plasticity, limited regeneration.
### Plasticity
- capability to change based on experience

### Regenerate 
- Capability to replace or repair

### In the [[Central Nervous System]]
- Little to no repair possible
- Rapid scar tissue
- Inhibitory influences from neuralgia
- Absence of growth-stimulating cues

### In the [[Peripheral Nervous System]]
- More ability to repair if the cell body is intact, Schwann cells are functional, and scar tissue formation does not occur too rapidly
