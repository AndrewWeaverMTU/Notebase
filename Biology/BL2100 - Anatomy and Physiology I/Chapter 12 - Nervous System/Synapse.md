- Connection between two [[Neurons]] or a neuron and its effector

### Electrical Synapse
- Gap junctions connect cells and allow faster transfer of information to synchronize the activity of a group of cells
- Much faster than Chemical Synapses
- Located mostly in the brain and the heart
### Chemical Synapse
- One-way transfer of information from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron
- Better for regulation
- More common
- Better for complex tasks like memory
- ### Signal Transmission at a Chemical Synapse
	- Nerve impulse opens Ca+ channels, Ca+ activates ligand-gated channels, channels release [[Neurotransmitters]], neurotransmitters trigger postsynaptic neurons.

### Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential
- Hyperpolarzing postsynaptic potential


### Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential
- Depolarizing postynaptic Potential

### Summation of Postsynaptic Potentials

^122112

- ### Spatial Summation
	- Multiple [[Neurons]] fire at the same time
	- Voting-like system. More excitatory responses -> [[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^9e0a6b|action potential]] is generated. More inhibitory responses -> no AP
- ### Temporal Summation
	- One neuron, frequency dependent. Once the frequency ([[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^121b82|graded potential]]) summates to pass threshold, an AP is generated
