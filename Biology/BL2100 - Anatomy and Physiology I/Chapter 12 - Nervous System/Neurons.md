- Electrically excitable
- 3 main parts
	- Cell Body - Soma
		- Contains the normal cell stuff
		- Has [[Nissl Bodies]]
	- [[Axons]]
		- Transmitting cables
	- [[Dendrites]]
		- Receiver/input/sensor portion
- 3 Main Structural Classifications
	- [[Multipolar Neurons]]
	- [[Bipolar Neurons]]
	- [[(Pseudo)unipolar Neurons]]
- 3 Main Functional Definitions
	- [[Sensory (Afferent) Neurons]]
	- [[Motor (Efferent) Neurons]]
	- [[Inter (Association) Neurons]]

### Presynaptic vs Postsynaptic
- Presynaptic send a signal over a [[Synapse]]
- Postsynaptic receive a signal over a [[Synapse]]
	- Can receive many different signals at the same time from all kinds of neurotransmitters.
