- Cause either an excitatory or inhibitory [[Electrical Signals in Neurons#^121b82|Graded Potential]]
- ACH is goated, often acts on both types of receptors. Neither type is unique to a particular neurotransmitter.
### Ionotropic Receptors
- [[Neurotransmitters |Neurotransmitter]] binding site + ion channel

### Metabotropic Receptors
- [[Neurotransmitters |Neurotransmitter]] binding site, no ion channel.
- Coupled with a separate G protein, “second messenger”
