### Cholinergic Neurons
- Cholinergic [[Neurons]] release [[Acetylcholine]] 
	- All [[Preganglionic Neurons]] are cholinergic
	- Sympathetic [[Postganglionic Nerurons]] that innervate sweat glands
	- All parasympathetic postganglionic neurons.


### Cholinergic Receptors
- Nicotinic receptors
	- Cell bodies of postganglionic neurons
- Muscarinic Receptors
	- All effectors innervated by parasympathetic postganglionic axons
	- Most sweat glands innervated by sympathetic postganglionic neurons
