- [[Preganglionic Neurons|Preganglionic Axons]] don’t always terminate in the [[Autonomic Ganglia#^53a380|Sympathetic Trunk Ganglia]]. When they don’t, they join to form splanchnic (SPLANGK-nic) nerves, which generally innervate abdominal visceral organs.

- Pierces diaphragm and enters the [[Autonomic Ganglia#^46e725|Celiac Ganglion]].
- Innervate blood vessels to the stomach, spleen liver, kidneys, and small intestine.
