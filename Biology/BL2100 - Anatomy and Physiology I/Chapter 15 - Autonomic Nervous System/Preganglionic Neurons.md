- First motor neuron in an [[Autonomic Nervous System#^93d903|Autonomic Motor Pathway]]
- Exits the [[Central Nervous System]] as part of a [[Cranial Nerves|Cranial]] or [[Spinal Nerves|Spinal]] nerve.
- Made up of [[Nerve Fibers#^415fd1|B Fibers]] 

## In the Sympathetic Division
- Have their cell bodies in the lateral horns of gray matter in the 12 Thoracic Vertebrae & the first two or three lumbar vertebrae of the [[Spinal Cord]]
	- This is why the division is also called the Thoracolumbar division.
- Exit through the anterior root of the spinal cord.

## In The Parasympathetic Division
-  Cell bodies in the nuclei of four cranial Nerves in the [[Brain Stem]] and in the lateral gray matter of sacral vertebrae 2-4. 
	- [[Oculomotor (III) Nerve]], [[Facial (VII) Nerve]], [[Glossopharyngial (IX) Nerve]], [[Vagus (X) Nerve]]
	- Also called the craniosacral division
