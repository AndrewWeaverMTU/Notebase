- Most inferior part of the [[Brain Stem]].

### Anatomy of the Medulla
- Pyramids
	- Bulges on the anterior part of the medulla
	- Formed by the large corticospinal tracts that pass from the [[Cerebrum]] to the [[Spinal Cord]]
		- Areas of [[White Matter]]
	- A common site for decussation (crossing) of ascending and descending tracts.
		- This is why one side of the brain controls the other half of the body.
- Centers
	- [[Gray Matter]] areas
	- Vital Centers
		- Cardiovascular Center
		- Respiratory Center
	- Non-Vital Centers
		- Vomiting, swallowing, sneezing, coughing, hiccupping. 
	- Houses five pairs of [[Cranial Nerves]], VIII-XII (8-12)
	- Portion of the ventricle found here - fourth ventricle
