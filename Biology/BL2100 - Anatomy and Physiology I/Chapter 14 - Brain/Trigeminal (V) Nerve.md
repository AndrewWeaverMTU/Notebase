- (three branches)
- **Largest cranial nerve**
- has 2 roots on the anterolateral (front outside) surface of [[The Pons]]
- carry touch, pain, and thermal signals.
- Has three major branches:

### Opthalmic Nerve
- smallest branch
 - passes through the [[Superior Orbital Fissure]]
- goes to the eye
- Sensory axons for the upper eyelid, [[Cornea]], lacrimal glands, upper nasal cavity, side of the nose, forehead, and anterior half of the scalp
	- Whole ass sinus area is innervated by the opthalmic
### Maxillary Nerve
- Goes to the jaw ([[Maxilla]])
- Passes through the [[Foramen Rotundum]]
- Sensory axons from the nose, palate, pharynx, upper teeth, and lower eyelid
	- Top mouth and bottom eye and nose.
### Mandibular Nerve
- Goes to the lower jaw ([[Mandible]])
- Largest branch
- Passes through the [[Foramen Ovale]]
- Sensory axons for the anterior 2/3 of tongue (doesn’t carry taste), cheek, mucosa, lower teeth, skin over the mandible, and mucosa of the floor of the mouth
	- Cheeks and bottom of mouth
