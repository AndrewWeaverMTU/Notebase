- A *state function* - **depends only on initial and final states**
- Relates spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process with the temperature at which that process takes place.

#### Reversible Processes
- A reversible process is one that takes place so slowly that it is always at equilibrium and its direction can be changed by an infinitesimally small. change in some condition.
- No real processes are reversible.

### Microstates
- “microstate” - specific configuration of the locations and energies of all the components (atoms/molecules) of a system.

- The more particle motion, the more entropy.
	- Entropy is directly related to temperature.
- Solid -> Liquid -> Gas, entropy change is positive
- Gas -> Liquid -> Solid, entropy change is negative
- The more particles, the more entropy.
- The more volume,  the more entropy
- The less ordered/tight/crystalline the structure, the more entropy.
