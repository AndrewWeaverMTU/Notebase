- Challenge of the [[Second & Third Laws of Thermodynamics - 16.3#^d2fcfb|Second Law of Thermodynamics]] - we need to find [[Entropy - 16.2|Entropy]] change of the system AND of the surroundings. 

### Gibbs Free Energy
- A way relation between system entropy and enthalpy using ONLY system values

### [[Spontanaeity - 16.1|Spontaneity]] Based on dG

Recall:
![[Second & Third Laws of Thermodynamics - 16.3#^d57e79]]

Free energy impacts spontaneity in the OPPOSITE manner, as it can be defined proportionally as dG <-> -dS
Therefore,

| dG > 0 | nonspontaneous | dS < 0 |
| ------ | -------------- | ------ |
| dG < 0 | spontaneous    | dS > 0 |
| dG = 0 | at equilibrium | dS = 0 |

#### Example Caculation
For the evaporation of liquid water at room temperature (298K), calculate the standard change in free energy and determine whether or not the reaction is spontaneous.

Know that:

| Substance | dH             | S                  |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| H20(l)    | -285.83 kJ/mol | 70.0 J k^-1 mol^-1 |
| H2O(g)    | -241.82 kJ/mol | 188.8 J k^1 mol^-1 |

### Standard Free Energy of Formation
- Calculated very similarly to the [[Second & Third Laws of Thermodynamics - 16.3#^1dd44e|Third Law of Thermodynamics]]. 
- The energy change that accompanies the formation of one mole of substance from its elements in standard states.
