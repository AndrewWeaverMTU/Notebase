### Second Law of Thermodynamics

- [[Entropy - 16.2|Entropy]] of an isolated thermodynamic system always increases during a spontaneous process.

- There are three possibilities for a process where heat flows between two things: ^d57e79
	1. The objects are at different temperatures. Heat flows from the hotter to the cooler object (the normal way). This is the way that happens *spontaneously*
		- dS > 0  (spontaneous)
	2. The objects are at different temperatures. Heat flows from the cooler to the hotter object (the wrong way). This will never happen spontaneously
		- dS < 0 (nonspontaneous)
	3. The objects are at the same temperatures, so the system is at equilibrium and the entropy change of the universe is zero.
		- dS = 0 (equilibrium)

#### Example Calculation: Will Ice Spontaneously Melt?
The entropy change for the process of ice melting is 22.1 J/K, and it requires that the surroundings transfer 6.00kJ of heat to the system. Is the process spontaneous at -10.00degC? Is it spontaneous at +10.00degC?

### Third Law of Thermodynamics

- Limiting Condition: The entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0K is 0.
- The standard entropy change for a reaction can be computed using the formula:
