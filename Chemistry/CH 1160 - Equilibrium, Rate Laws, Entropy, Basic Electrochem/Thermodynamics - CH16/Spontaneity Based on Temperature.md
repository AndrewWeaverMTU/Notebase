- Recall the equation for [[Free Energy - 16.4|Free Energy]]: ∆G = ∆H - T∆S
- Temperature is in Kelvin, so it can only be positive.
- Temperature scales the [[Entropy - 16.2|Entropy Change]].

### **Possible Cases**
- **Both ∆H and ∆S are positive**
	- Endothermic process, increase in system entropy (S). if ∆H > T∆S, the process is nonspontaneous. This kind of process is *spontaneous at high temperatures and nonspontaneous at low temperatures*
- **Both ∆H and ∆S are negative**
	- Exothermic process, decrease in system entropy (S). If ∆H < T∆S, the process is nonspontaneous. This kind of process is  *spontaneous at low temperatures and nonspontaneous at high temperatures*
- **∆H is positive, ∆S is negative**
	- ∆G will always be positive in this case. Endothermic, decrease in entropy. This process is *nonspontaneous at all temperatures*
- **∆H is negative, ∆S is positive**
	- ∆G will always be negative. Exothermic, increase in entropy. This process is *spontaneous at all temperatures*
