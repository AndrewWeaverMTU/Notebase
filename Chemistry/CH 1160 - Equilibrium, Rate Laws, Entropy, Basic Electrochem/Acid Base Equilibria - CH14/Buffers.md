- A buffer is a solution containing small amounts of a weak [[Bronsted-Lowry Acids & Bases |acid-base pair]].
- They resist pH changes when strong acids and bases are added
- Their resistance to change is measured as their **buffer capacity**
	- amount of acid/base that can be added to a sol’n before its pH changes significantly (usually by 1 unit)

### Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
- Relates buffer concentrations, pKa, and pH
