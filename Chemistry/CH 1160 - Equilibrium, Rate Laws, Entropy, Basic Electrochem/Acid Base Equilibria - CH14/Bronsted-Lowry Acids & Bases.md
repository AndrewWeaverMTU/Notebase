#### Bronsted-Lowry Acids

^7c92ed

- A Bronsted-Lowry acid is a proton **donor**
- When an acid donates H+, what’s left over is called the conjugate base.
- For strong acids, the conjugate base will be weak.

#### Bronsted-Lowry Bases

^ece4c7

- A Bronsted-Lowry base is a proton **acceptor**
- When a base accepts H+, what’s left over is called the conjugate acid.
- For strong bases, the conjugate acid will be weak.

### Acid Ionization
- Reaction between a [[#^7c92ed |Bronsted-Lowry Acid]] and water. 
- Water acts as a base
- Usually creates Hydronium (H30+) and a conjugate base

```

### Base Ionization
- Reaction between a [[#^ece4c7 |Bronsted-Lowry Base]] and water.
- Water acts as an acid
- Usually creates Hydroxide (OH-) and a conjugate base

### Amphitrotic Species
- Species capable of both donating and receiving protons, like water.
- Can act as an acid or a base.
- called [[Amphoteric]] under all other definitions.
- Can react with themselves in a process called Autoionization
