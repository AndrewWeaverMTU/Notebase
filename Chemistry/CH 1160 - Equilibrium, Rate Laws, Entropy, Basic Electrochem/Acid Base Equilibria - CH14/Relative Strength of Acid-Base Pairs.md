- All strong acids (and bases) are completely ionized in water, but they still can vary in strength.
	- To figure out what their relative strength is, their ionization is measured in sol’ns more acidic (or basic) than water is.
- For strong acids/bases, their conjugates are of negligible strength

### Example: Calculating Ionization Constants for Acid-Base Pairs
- Using KNO2 = 2.17 E-11, calculate the Ka of HNO2, its conjugate acid
