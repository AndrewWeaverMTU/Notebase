### Predicting Precipitation
- Can be found by calculating the reaction quotient and comparing it to the solubility product.
- If Q (reaction quotient) > K (solubility product), the Sol’n is supersaturated and precipitation occurs
- if Q < K, the sol’n is unsaturated, so precipitation does not occur.
