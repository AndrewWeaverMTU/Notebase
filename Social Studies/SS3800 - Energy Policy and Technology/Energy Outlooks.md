- Measures of how the energy industry & field is changing
- imperfect but useful for identifying trends and learning about the state of the industry
- Make use of models like [[EROI]] over time
- Can suffer from professional, institutional, and political bias.

### Current Outlook
- [[Oil]] consumption will peak and then decline by 2030 (most countries peaked in 2005)
- [[Liquid Natural Gas]] grows substantially by 2030
- Electricity grows substantially by 2050
- Geothermal and hydrogen are uncertain
- World energy growth is set to be led by wind and solar (they're cheap af, big long-term monetary incentive to switch)
