	- Uranium ore, crude oil, wood, etc.
- ### End-use Energy (*Energy Carriers*)
	- The energy content of primary energy delivered to the consumer at the point of end-use
	- Electricity :D, Gasoline
- ### Useful Energy
	- What the end-use energy is transformed into
	- Light, heat, mechanical energy
- ### Energy Services
	- Applications of useful energy to human wants and needs
	- *benefits that energy carriers produce for human well-being*
	- Thermal comfort, mobility, 


### Major forms of energy:
- Thermal
	- Sloppy. Awful. Biproduct of all the other forms
- Chemical
	- Lower entropy, more efficient
	- Dependent on stable molecular structures
- Radiant
- Electrical
	- Lower entropy, more efficient
	- Easy to control 
- Mechanical
