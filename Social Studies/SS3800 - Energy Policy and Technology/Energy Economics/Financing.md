## Project Financing
### Financing Options
- Debt (loans, bonds)
- Existing Equity (your own money, your own abilities)
- New equity (issuing additional stock, inviting a new member)

#### Debt Vs Equity
- Debt is just money. They give you money, you pay it back steadily over time
- Equity has a stake in it. It is in the investor's best interest to work for the success of the project. Their profits are related to the success of the business.

### Cost Recovery
- Ratepayers in regulated states
- Wholesale purchasers
