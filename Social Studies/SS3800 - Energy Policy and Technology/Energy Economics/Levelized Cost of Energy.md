- The net present value of the unit cost of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset
- Takes into account capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate for each plant type
- Greatly varies by the region
$$\text{LCOE} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Capacity Factor} + \text{Variable Costs}}$$

## Other Concepts
- ARR - annual revenue requirement - avg revenue needed to break even over a lifetime
- LACE - Levelized avoided costs of energy - cost of electricity & **value for the grid** (grid-centric calculation). 
	- value of increasing generation and capacity with respect to the economics of the grid.
