- Economics - The study of how society uses scarce resources to produce valuable commodities and distribute them among different people

## Key Definitions
- Revenue = Total Sum
- Profit = Total Sum - Costs
- Average Cost = Avg per unit of capacity OR energy
- Marginal Cost = cost of production of the next unit
	- Need more energy, but power plant is at 100% capacity. To go to the next unit, marginal cost is high as we have to increase production capacity, not just production.
- Fixed Cost = a cost that does not vary with output
	- [[Capital Cost]] (capital expenses, capex) (steel, concrete)
- Variable Cost = A cost that does vary with output
	- Operating costs (operating expenses, opex) (fuel, labor)
	- Always cost per unit of energy $50 / MWh

## Homo Economicus
- Rational + maximization of individual self-interest
- Collective interest - adding up everyone in a group's self-interests
- Key assumption of economics

## Energy is a Good
- Energy is a prerequisite (essential) [[Goods|Good]] 
	- It is used as a mean to the ends, but is generally also the control of the ends.

## Virtues of the Energy Market ( & just the market)
- Everyone strives to maximize the production & application of capital.
- Acts in only your own gain -> ends up producing good results outside of your original intent (invisible hand - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations)
- Energy has a fantastic market
	- SO many buyers and sellers
	- Wide distribution of goods and captial
	- Excellent product information
	- Freedom of entry (and exit)
	- Abstract timeframe

## Failures of the Energy Market
- Link to [[Market Failures]]
- Power generation and distribution is pretty much always a natural monopoly, which is then regulated by the govt.
