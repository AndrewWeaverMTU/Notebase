$$\huge W = F \cdot D$$
### Variable Force
$$\huge \int_a^bF(x)dx$$
#### Example
Suppose that 2J of work is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 30cm to 42cm.

How much work is needed to stretch the spring form 35cm to 40cm? If the spring is stretched from its natural length with 3J of work, how far was it stretched?
